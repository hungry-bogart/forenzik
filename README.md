# forenzik
Bash script in development to help expeditiously check files for hidden metadata via common tools to save time in CTF competitions.

## Installation

This is a simple bash script. I would use the following method:

Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/hungry-bogart/forenzik.git```

Enter the directory
```cd forenzik```

Make the script executable
```chmod +x forenzik```

Copy the script to make it executable anywhere in your terminal
```sudo cp forenzik /usr/local/bin/```

Run the script
```forenzik```

Hit enter

The script will execute and ask you to find your file. 
Results for each tool are stored in a timestamped folder. 
It looks like this atm.
